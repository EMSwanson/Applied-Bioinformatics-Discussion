# Group 2: Example Dataset

Your group will be in charge of editing the `example_dataset` repository! 

After you clone the repository `https://github.umn.edu/liux1299/Git-Tutorial.git`, go to the `example_dataset` directory. You should see a `names.txt` file and three repositories here: `citations`, `regions`, `text_files`.

Here are your tasks:

1. One person should edit the `names.txt` file and add 2-3 names to the list. 

2. Another person will edit `Teosinte.txt` located in the `text_files` repository. Open this file with a text editor and delete line 10 of this file.

3. A third person will edit `2H_contigs_regions.txt` located in the `regions` repository. Open this file with a text editor and delete 3 lines of your choice.

4. If there are additional members of this group, go ahead and navigate to the `citation` repository. Add a citation of your choosing.

**PAUSE** Please wait for further instruction before commiting your changes.

**Last step:** add, commit and push your changes!
- Use `git commit -am "type an informative message"`
- Followed by `git push`

Make sure you `git pull` before you start editing the file! Otherwise, edit away! 

If you have more than 3 people in your group with computers, have the remaining people choose one of the above tasks and add their edits.
