# Group 1: Manuscript

Your group has the pleasure of editing the manuscript!

After you clone the repository `https://github.umn.edu/liux1299/Git-Tutorial.git`, go to the `manuscript` directory. There should be a markdown file called `LinuxDistros.md`. Open this file in your favorite text editor.

Here are your tasks:

1. One person, use markdown headers to start a new section.
- If you need a reference, Google "markdown cheat sheet" and you should find it. 

2. Another person, add a 2-3 sentence paragraph undder the headers. This can be about anything.

3. The last person, find a link to an image (any image you would like) on the website and embed it into the document.

**Last step:** add, commit and push your changes!
- Use `git commit -am "type an informative message"`
- Followed by `git push`

**PAUSE** Please wait for further instruction before commiting your changes.

Make sure you `git pull` before you start editing the file! Otherwise, edit away! 

If you have more than 3 people in your group with computers, have the remaining people choose one of the above tasks and add their edits.
