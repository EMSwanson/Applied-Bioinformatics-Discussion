# Group 3: Scripts

Your group will be responsible for editing the `scripts` repository.

After you clone the repository `https://github.umn.edu/liux1299/Git-Tutorial.git`, go to the `scripts` directory. You should see 5 scripts here.

*Note:* All of these scripts have been tested and work. Feel free to test them on the example datasets in the `example_datasets` repository.

Here are your tasks:

1. Each person in this group should choose a **single** script and add a comment to the script. 

2. If you are a more advanced user, you are welcome to add a line of code and/or edit a line of code.

For all members of the group, make sure you have made at least one edit.

**PAUSE** Please wait for further instruction before commiting your changes.

**Last step:** add, commit and push your changes!
- Use `git commit -am "type an informative message"`
- Followed by `git push`

Make sure you `git pull` before you start editing the file! Otherwise, edit away!
